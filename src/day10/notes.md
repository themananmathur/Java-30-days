# Day 10 – Mini Project: ATM Simulator

## Learnings

* Brought together concepts from Days 1–9 into a working mini project.
* Practiced classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and arrays with resizing.
* Learned to handle basic user input and menu-driven programs with loops and conditionals.

## Key Points

* **Account** class: holds id, name, pin, balance, and transaction history.
* **Bank** class: manages multiple accounts, supports add, search, and transfer.
* **ATMMain**: CLI interface for login, balance check, deposit, withdraw, transfer, and history.
* Transactions stored in a `String[]`, resized manually (like how `ArrayList` works internally).

## Hands-on Task

* Created `Account`, `Bank`, and `ATMMain` classes.
* Added sample accounts for quick testing.
* Implemented deposit, withdraw, transfer, and transaction history.
* Ran the program and tested features end-to-end in a simple CLI flow.
