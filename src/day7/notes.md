# Day 7 â€“ Encapsulation

## Learnings
- Understood the concept of **Encapsulation** in Java.
- Used **private fields** to restrict direct access from outside the class.
- Implemented **getters and setters** to provide controlled access and validation.
- Realized how encapsulation helps with **data hiding** and maintaining integrity.

## Hands-on
- Created a `Student` class with private fields (`name`, `age`, `roll`).
- Added getters and setters, including validation for `age`.
- Wrote a `Main` class to create student objects and interact with them through encapsulated methods.
