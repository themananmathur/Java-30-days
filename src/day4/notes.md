# Day 4 â€“ Methods & Functions

## Learnings
- Understood how to define and call methods in Java.
- Learned about different method types:
    - Methods without parameters and return values.
    - Methods with parameters but no return values.
    - Methods with both parameters and return values.
- Saw how methods make code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.
- Explored the difference between classic `switch-case` (using `:` + `break`) and modern `switch expressions` (using `->`).

## Hands-on
- Built a **Mini ATM** program:
    - Implemented reusable methods for `checkBalance`, `deposit`, and `withdraw`.
    - Added a looping menu system with `switch-case` for user choices.
    - Ensured input validation (e.g., no negative deposits, no withdrawing more than balance).
