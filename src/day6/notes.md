# Day 6 â€“ OOP Concepts (Class, Object, Constructors)

## Learnings
- Explored how a **Class** acts as a blueprint containing properties (fields) and behaviors (methods).
- Learned how an **Object** is an instance of a class, created using the `new` keyword.
- Practiced using **Constructors** to initialize object properties.
- Used the `this` keyword to differentiate between class fields and constructor parameters.

## Hands-on
- Created a `Car` class with properties (`brand`, `model`, `year`).
- Implemented a constructor to initialize these properties.
- Added methods (`start()`, `showDetails()`) to define behaviors.
- Instantiated multiple `Car` objects and invoked their methods.
