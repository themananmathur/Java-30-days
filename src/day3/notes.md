# Day 3 – Control Statements

## Learnings
- Explored decision-making and loops in Java.
- Understood:
    - `if`, `if-else`, `if-else if` ladder
    - `switch` statement
    - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
    - Intro to Iterators
- Learned the difference between breaking and continuing loops.

## Hands-on
- Wrote small programs using conditional checks.
- Practiced loop variations (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- Implemented logic to **print prime numbers up to 100**.
- Compared a basic vs optimized approach (checking divisibility up to `num/2` vs up to `√num`).
