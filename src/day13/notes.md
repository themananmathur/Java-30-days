# Day 13 – Collections: List & Set

## Learnings
- Learned the basics of the **Collections Framework** in Java.
- Understood the differences between **List** and **Set** interfaces.
- Practiced with `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` (ordered, allow duplicates).
- Practiced with `HashSet` (unordered, no duplicates).
- Learned how overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()` in custom classes (like `Student`) ensures uniqueness in Sets.
- Iterated through collections using **for-each loops** and **Iterators**.

## Hands-on Tasks
1. **ArrayList Example** – Created and displayed student records stored in an `ArrayList` to maintain insertion order.
2. **LinkedList Example** – Added and displayed student records in a `LinkedList`, demonstrating insertion/removal operations.
3. **HashSet Example** – Stored student records in a `HashSet` and ensured uniqueness by preventing duplicate student IDs.
