# Day 2 – Variables & User Input

## Learnings
- (Practice) Declared and used variables of types `String`, `int`, `double`, and `boolean`.
- Printed variable values using `System.out.println`.
- Took user input from the terminal using the `Scanner` class.
- Handled text, integer, and decimal input with `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, and `nextDouble()`.
- Cleared the input buffer when mixing input types with `scanner.nextLine()`.
- Performed arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for the Simple Calculator program.

## Hands-on Tasks
1. **Print Variables (Practice)** – Declared and printed variables of different types.
2. **User Input Example (Practice)** – Collected user input for name, age, height, and student status.
3. **Simple Calculator** – Performed arithmetic operations on two numbers with a safeguard against division by zero.
